# Blumengasse_IoT

I brougth my parents house into the 21<sup>st</sup> by setting up a local Django webserver that can communicate with sensors and IoT devices via the local Wifi. As of right now there are only two humidity and temperature sensors implemented. But more will come soon!

These are the sensors I built. The Arduino code, the component list and the CAD files for the cases are not here yet. But if you are interested stay tuned. I'll upload them soon! Want to do some cleaning first.
